          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <h3>A 3rd generation family run, certified organic orchard at 8000 ft in the Himalayas</h3>
          <p>It was in mid 20th century, when  our grandparents Late Smt Neema devi and Sh Chura Ram Kashyap decided to establish this apple orchard at an elevation of around 8000 ft above sea level , a task full of challenges they managed to plant around 900 tree sapling of varieties such as Royal red delicious , Golden , Red Golden , Rich red and a few other varieties. After that Sh Chander Kashyap and Smt Saraswati Kashyap took charge of the orchard and with their hardwork improved the quality and the productivity of the apples . 
            Sh Ved Kashyap (Retired as a Principal) along with his wife Smt Kalpana Kashyap and sister Vijaya Kumari also started looking after the orchards and now the new member of the gang Mr Utkarsh Kashyap has also developed some interest in the apple cultivation , all of us are now practicing new scientific techniques to improve our output of apple cultivation in terms of quality and quantity , such as improving our pruning techniques , fertigation  and planting new red delicious and gala varieties of apples . 
            Now we have thought of going online , so that we can sell our fruits all over the country and the customers would also get fresh farm fruits straight to their table as we call it (Farm to table) ..</p>

          <h2>Benefits of eating apples</h2>
          <p>Not only do apples taste delicious on their own or when added to dishes but they come loaded with health benefits. “Apples have been linked to numerous health benefits, including improved gut health and reduced risk of stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and some cancers.

            According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a medium-sized apple is a good source of fiber: It contains 4.4 grams of fiber, covering 16 percent of the daily value (DV). Also, the same apple offers 8.4 milligrams of vitamin C, providing more than 9 percent of your DV, along with small amounts of other vitamins and minerals.
